 * Creative Commons Legal Code
 *
 * CC0 1.0 Universal
 *
 * CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
 * SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
 * RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
 * CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR
 * THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR
 * DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
 * PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
 *
 * Statement of Purpose
 *
 * The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 * exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
 * subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 * authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 *
 * Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
 * purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
 * works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
 * claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
 * and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
 * purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
 * contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
 * further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
 * reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
 * efforts of others.
 *
 * For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
 * of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with
 * a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
 * Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to
 * the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of
 * his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and
 * intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
 *
 * 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 * protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 * Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
 * to, the following:
 *
 * i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
 * and translate a Work; ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s)
 * and/or performer(s); iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a
 * person's image or likeness depicted in a Work; iv. rights protecting against
 * unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in
 * paragraph 4(a), below; v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination,
 * use and reuse of data in a Work; vi. database rights (such as those arising
 * under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
 * March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
 * implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
 * directive); and vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
 * throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
 * implementations thereof.
 *
 * 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
 * applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 * unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
 * and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
 * known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
 * action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 * duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 * extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
 * copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
 * commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
 * makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to
 * the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
 * Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
 * termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
 * enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
 * Statement of Purpose.
 *
 * 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
 * judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
 * shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
 * Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
 * Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
 * royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable
 * and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
 * in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
 * provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions),
 * (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 * for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 * advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be
 * deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work.
 * Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
 * ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness
 * shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer
 * hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her
 * remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
 * associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either
 * case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 *
 * 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 *
 * a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 * surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. b. Affirmer
 * offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
 * concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
 * without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
 * particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
 * defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not

 * GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991
 *
 * Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street,
 * Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and
 * distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
 * allowed.
 *
 * Preamble
 *
 * The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
 * share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
 * to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
 * software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
 * most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
 * whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation
 * software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You
 * can apply it to your programs, too.
 *
 * When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
 * General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
 * to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
 * wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
 * can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
 * you know you can do these things.
 *
 * To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
 * deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
 * restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
 * copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 *
 * For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
 * for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You
 * must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
 * must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 *
 * We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
 * offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
 * and/or modify the software.
 *
 * Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
 * everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If
 * the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
 * recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
 * problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
 * reputations.
 *
 * Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
 * wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
 * individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
 * proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
 * licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 *
 * The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
 * follow.
 *
 * GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
 * MODIFICATION
 *
 * 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
 * placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
 * of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such
 * program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
 * or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
 * the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
 * translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
 * without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed
 * as "you".
 *
 * Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
 * by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program
 * is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
 * contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
 * made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the
 * Program does.
 *
 * 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
 * as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 * appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
 * disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
 * License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
 * the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
 *
 * You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
 * at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 *
 * 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
 * thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
 * modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
 * also meet all of these conditions:
 *
 * a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
 * you changed the files and the date of any change.
 *
 * b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
 * in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
 * licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
 * License.
 *
 * c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
 * you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
 * ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
 * copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
 * you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
 * these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
 * (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
 * such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
 * an announcement.)
 *
 * These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
 * sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
 * considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
 * and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
 * separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
 * which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
 * on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
 * the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 *
 * Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
 * rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
 * right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
 * the Program.
 *
 * In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
 * the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
 * distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
 * License.
 *
 * 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
 * Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
 * and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 *
 * a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
 * which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 * medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 *
 * b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
 * any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
 * source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
 * source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 * medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 *
 * c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
 * distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for
 * noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
 * code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
 * above.)
 *
 * The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 * modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
 * the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
 * definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
 * installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source
 * code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
 * either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
 * and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
 * component itself accompanies the executable.
 *
 * If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
 * copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 * source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
 * even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
 * object code.
 *
 * 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
 * expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy,
 * modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
 * terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received
 * copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 * terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 *
 * 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
 * However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
 * Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you
 * do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
 * Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
 * this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
 * distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
 *
 * 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
 * the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
 * copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
 * You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
 * the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
 * by third parties to this License.
 *
 * 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
 * you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to
 * satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
 * pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
 * Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
 * royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
 * directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
 * it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
 * Program.
 *
 * If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 * particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
 * the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 *
 * It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
 * or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
 * this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
 * software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
 * practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
 * software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
 * application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
 * she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
 * cannot impose that choice.
 *
 * This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
 * consequence of the rest of this License.
 *
 * 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
 * countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
 * copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
 * explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
 * that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. 
 * In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
 * body of this License.
 *
 * 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 * the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
 * similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
 * new problems or concerns.
 *
 * Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
 * specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
 * version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
 * that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
 * Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
 * you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
 *
 * 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
 * whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
 * permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
 * Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
 * exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
 * preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
 * promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 *
 * NO WARRANTY
 *
 * 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
 * THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
 * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 * PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
 * IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
 * THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM
 * PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
 * CORRECTION.
 *
 * 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 * WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
 * REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 * INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 * OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 * LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
 * THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 * PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 * POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 *
 * END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 * How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 *
 * If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
 * use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
 * which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 *
 * To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
 * attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
 * exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
 * line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 *
 * <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 * Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 *
 * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
 * the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
 * Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
 * version.
 *
 * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
 * ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
 * FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more
 * details.
 *
 * You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
 * this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51
 * Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
 *
 * Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 *
 * If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when
 * it starts in an interactive mode:
 *
 * Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
 * with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free
 * software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
 * type `show c' for details.
 *
 * The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 * parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
 * called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
 * mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
 *
 * You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 * school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
 * necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 *
 * Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
 * `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
 *
 * <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice
 *
 * This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
 * proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
 * consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
 * library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
 * License instead of this License.

    // There are three issues with this algorithm:
    //
    //   1. The amount of steps in the ladder is not
    //      constant, since we must assume k[n-1]=1
    //      (it follows that k[n]=0). A side effect
    //      of this is that we cannot handle a point
    //      at infinity (k[n-1]=0).
    //
    //   2. On the off chance we pass in a "low"
    //      scalar (lacking several hi bits), there
    //      will be a noticeable difference in cycles.
    //
    //   3. The algorithm cannot handle k = -1 mod n.
    //      It will overflow to infinity.
    //
    // To avoid two of these issues, we _negate_ the
    // scalar in the event that bits(k) < bits(-k). If
    // we do end up negating a scalar, we negate the
    // resulting point in constant time at the end.
    //
    // Doing this not only solves the point at infinity
    // issue (i.e. N-0=N=0), but it also ensures a scalar
    // is within at least 1 bit of the order (usually).
    //
    // The final edge case can be solved with a
    // comparison and subsequent constant-time swap at
    // the end.
    //
    // Note that our scalar recoding here disallows
    // the possibility of curves with a cofactor > 1.
    //
    // A possibility for a perf improvement involves
    // using the ZACAU method. This is faster assuming
